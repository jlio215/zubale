## Overview

You have been given a project that **compiles successfully** but does not work
correctly at runtime.

## The Problem

- The application starts but fails to fully function
- Some operations fail at runtime
- Error messages may be incomplete or misleading

## Your Goal

Get the application to:
1. Start successfully
2. Connect and interact correctly with the PostgreSQL database
3. Respond to API requests as documented in the README
4. Verify that all endpoints behave correctly (e.g. filters, results, etc)

## Getting Started

1. Run the application and observe its behavior
2. Debug and fix issues as you find them

## Notes

- Focus on identifying and fixing the cause of the malfunction.
- You do not need to add new features.
